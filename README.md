# Adastral, GUI components (belmont)

This is Adastral's frontend, written in Godot. 

To build/launch the project, download/build the C++ component, (winter)[https://github.com/adastralgroup/winter], and put the library in `bin/`. Then download the latest version of Godot and open the project.
If all's gone well, you should get no/very little errors in the output and you should be able to just run it.
